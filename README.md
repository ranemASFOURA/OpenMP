# Numerical Integration and Mandelbrot Set Area Calculation using OpenMP

This repository contains solutions to two computational tasks implemented in C with OpenMP for parallel programming:

1. **Numerical Integration**: Approximates the integral of \( f(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \) over the interval \([1, 10]\) using the rectangle (Riemann sum) method.
2. **Mandelbrot Set Area Calculation**: Estimates the area of the Mandelbrot set using the Monte Carlo method with both serial and parallel implementations.

The project includes source code, Makefiles for automation, and profiling options using `gprof` for performance analysis.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- `log_integration.c`: Source code for the numerical integration task.
- `Mandelbrot.c`: Source code for the Mandelbrot set area calculation.
- `Makefile`: Automation script to build, run, and profile both tasks.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:
- **GCC** compiler with OpenMP support
- **GNU** Make To automate build, run, and profiling processes
- **gprof** for profiling

## Task 1: Numerical Integration using OpenMP

This task calculates the integral of \( f(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \) over the interval \([1, 10]\) using numerical integration with parallelization in OpenMP. The method divides the area under the curve into small rectangles, using OpenMP to distribute calculations across multiple threads.

### Instructions

1. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   - The program prompts for the number of rectangles (`N`) to define the integration accuracy.
   - It then performs the integration with varying thread counts (e.g., 2, 4, 8) and displays the result and execution time for each configuration.
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

3. **Profile with gprof**:
   - Run the profiling command to analyze the programâ€™s performance.
   ```bash
   make profile
   ```
   - The profiling report is saved as `profile.txt`.

### Output Files
- `profile.txt`: Profiling report generated by `gprof` for the numerical integration task.

## Task 2: Monte Carlo Mandelbrot Area Calculation

This task uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the area of the Mandelbrot set. It includes both serial and parallel implementations, where the parallel version leverages OpenMP to distribute computations across threads.

### Instructions

1. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   - The program first performs the area calculation in serial mode, then runs parallel versions with different thread counts ( 2, 4, 8, 16, 32).
   - Results include area estimates and execution times for each thread configuration.
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

3. **Profile with gprof**:
   - Run the profiling command to generate performance insights.
   ```bash
   make profile
   ```
   - The profiling report is saved as `profile_report.txt`.

### Output Files
- `profile_report.txt`: Profiling report generated by `gprof` for the Mandelbrot area calculation.
